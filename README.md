<h2>Project Purpose</h2>

To provide an easy method of charging batteries connected to a Growatt SPH inverter using MQTT. This has only been tested on my Growatt SPH5000 with three GBLI6532 6.5kWh batteries connected. I suspect this will work for other Growatt hybrid inverters too.

This code is currently setup to use a RS485 Serial to WiFi adaptor, connected to the RS485 port on the inverter. The adaptor I used was around Â£25 on Amazon.co.uk (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B097C8PT6F).
